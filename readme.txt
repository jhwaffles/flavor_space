Welcome to flavor space project! It is an expansion on my group project from Georgia Tech (https://github.com/jhwaffles/cse6242-team58-project). It leverages NLP and machine learning to generate flavor embeddings off of a recipe -> ingredient -> molecules data set. These embeddings are the basis of the recipe recommendation app based off of flavor profiles. There are some other fun features in this app - feel free to play around.
